ref_mm.c that uses implicit free list,
we need to applying tricks from 9.9.13&9.9.14,which are:
1.use explicit free list,we need to store pred and succ in effective load.
2.free list are segeregated into different groups base on it's size:
each time we call place(),it needs to cut the block if possible ,and add it to the free list grouped by size.
each time we call extend_heap(),free(),add it to free list.
find_fit() search the free list based on its size.

programming rules don't allow us to use array to store the free list,
and I find it hard to get a solution without using array.
