Part A:
I use a stack to simulate LRU, it will update the latest item on top of the stack,and delete item from the bottom of stack if you need to evict.
cache is an array:
mycache[S] ,each element contains a stack representing the line of  one specific set,if E==1 then there is only one line.
cache looks like this:(S==3,E==4)
- - - -
- - - -
- - - -
load and store share the same function,assuming we only do all the work on cache,and change them only if we have to do(like the data you need to store
has to be evicted at the time)
modify means load a data and store it,so when we store it ,it will always be 
"hit".
I don't konw why I can't test it on test-csim,
so I have to test it manually,and it works fine.(check ref.txt),
