look at the description and hints of shlab.pdf
An important rule from book:
G3. Protect accesses to shared global data structures by blocking all signals. If
a handler shares a global data structure with the main program or with
other handlers, then your handlers and main program should temporarily
block all signals while accessing (reading or writing) that data structure.
The reason for this rule is that accessing a data structure d from the main
program typically requires a sequence of instructions. If this instruction
sequence is interrupted by a handler that accesses d, then the handler
might find d in an inconsistent state, with unpredictable results. Temporarily
blocking signals while you access d guarantees that a handler will
not interrupt the instruction sequence.
