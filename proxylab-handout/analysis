Part B:
there are many ways to implement a concurrent server.
I have written two types of them,the first one is a
concurrent event-driven server and the second one is a prethreaded
server.
event-driven server:
combine tiny.c and echoservers.c from book.
we also need a sig handler that allow dynamic process run in BG.
prethread:
only need to change a function from echoervert_pre.c
